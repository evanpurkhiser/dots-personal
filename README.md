## Evan Purkhiser's Configuration files

[![Build Status](https://github.com/evanpurkhiser/dots-personal/workflows/check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/evanpurkhiser/dots-personal/actions?query=workflow%3Acheck)

These are my personal configuration files for my various machines.
Configuration files are grouped into different 'groups' that allow for specific
installations based on the type of machine the dotfiles are being installed on.
For example, the dotfiles installed for a server would be different than the
dotfiles installed on my home desktop or work laptop.

These dotfiles are managed using the `dots` [dotfile management
utility](https://github.com/evanpurkhiser/dots).

## Dotfile groups

The following groups are used for my dotfiles:

| Group Name   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `base`       | The base group is installed for all environments. This includes the most basic and cross platform configurations. For example, bash, vim, and other environment independent configurations are placed here. |
| `common/*`   | Common groups apply to various machines and are generally more generic. This includes platform (osx / linux) and development specific groupigns.                                                            |
| `machines/*` | The machine groups are specific to a single machine. This includes configuration files for programs installed locally to that machine that are not intended to be shared elsewhere.                         |
